# CBOOT Project

This is a small project I made to Erase the CMOS. It is only for educational purposes. YOU are soley responsible for what YOU do with this code. It is provided "as-is", It should work for the most part but. If you run into any problems running it, it is CPU dependant (meaning you need to compile it for each CPU).

Anyways, I made this as a utility in-case of a forgotten BIOS password. You should be able to use this to wipe the CMOS back to factory. In other words, factory reset the CMOS (clearing the BIOS password).

## Disclaimer

Please do NOT use this for malicious activities. It is a utility, so I strongly advise you use it as such.
