List:

  - SNSH - Simple Network SHell project.
  
  - psh  - good example of regular shell.
  
  - psh-shouldn't - bad example of read line.
                    it's bad because, it's an
                    example of making something
                    more complex and harder than
                    it should be. psh ^^ is better
                    because its simple. There is
                    no reason to make something
                    harder than it is.
