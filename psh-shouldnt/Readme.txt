==================================
PSH ( Phil's SHell ) v0.02a
==================================
Okay I finally implemented some
stuff in my shell. Everything,
should work okay on Windows. Have
not gotten to test on Linux yet.
==================================
Will have to do more to get it
working fully.
==================================
      WARNING: Shouldn't do it
           NOT this way.
==================================
Updated: readline should function
         better now but, still
         could be issues... a lot
         of testing needs to be
         done.
